I tried to follow the requirements of the assignment. I thought there would be some connection between ICD codes and amount paid, so I selected them for analysis and tried to find the main options. In additional analysis, I tried to find the connection between Z733 (the most common option in ICD) and the gender of the beneficiary. But when I finished the code, I found that there was no GNDR_CD in the form. So I changed it to the state where the provider or facility is located. To be honest, I must say that this is not the best analysis because I did not use more data, such as population or prevalence of each state. So it still has some room for development.
During the code process, when I got stuck, I tried to fix it according to the prompts under the code I ran, or tried to use Google to find how to complete the process in my mind.
